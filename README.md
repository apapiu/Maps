# Interactive Maps in R using the leaflet and tigris packages.

Using the leaflet and the tigris R packages one can make really awesome, good looking maps with a great deal of control over 
the way the map looks and feels. In this repository I explore different data (mostly census data for now) and see how to plot it
using leaflet. There are different zoom levels: states, counties, zip codes, tracts and I will explore how to make tigris work
with the acs package.
